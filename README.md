## employee-managment-system

Employee Managment System is Angular CRUD application created for managing data. I builded it so I can practice creating CRUD apps in Angular



## usage

Through the form a user can import data (name, email, start of work date, phone number and skills) about a employee. This data can be read in employee list, edited and deleted.


## technologies

This app is built with Angular, [ng-zorro-antd](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en) Angular library for UI and [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for storing data.



## building

Install [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), start it with `json-server --watch db.json` and run `ng serve --open` in your terminal.
